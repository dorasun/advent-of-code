# advent-of-code

Welcome to my repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! So far I've only really participated in [2022](#2022) but maybe I'll go back to previous years if I find myself with some extra time :')

#### 2022
For 2022 I'm using JavaScript to refresh myself on the syntax; all programs can be run with `node part#.js` where # is 1 or 2 depending on which part of the puzzle it is. Please excuse my extra `console.log()`s and take the last printed output as the answer. All errors can be ignored (day6 I throw an exception instead of reformatting my code to run in a function lol may update at some point if it ends up bothering me).
