# advent-of-code

Welcome to my repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)! I only kept it up til day 10 in [2022](#2022), so hoping to get to day 12 in [2023](#2023)! Still dreaming that one day I'll go back to previous years and solve more of them :')

This repo is structured /year/day#, with part1, part2, and an index.txt file inside. Please ignore any extra console outputs and take just the last printed output as the answer!

#### 2023
For 2023 I'm using Python, which I don't have a lot of experience with! One of my professors once said "if you can read you know how to code in Python", so looking forward to getting some practice with it.

Run any given program with `python3 part#.py`

#### 2022
For 2022 I'm using JavaScript to refresh myself on the syntax! It's one of the languages I know best, but I don't use it super often so it makes for good practice. Hopefully things haven't changed too much since I last touched it.

Run any given program with `node part#.js`
